Sites get blocked during exams, social media goes dark during protests, and some services simply don’t work because they’ve geo-restricted the entire region.\nA VPN isn’t a luxury in Iraq — it’s infrastructure. Whether you’re a freelancer needing uninterrupted access to client tools, a student trying to reach research databases, or someone who just wants their YouTube recommendations to stop being weird, you need a reliable VPN.\nI’ve tested over a dozen VPN services from Erbil and Sulaymaniyah over the past year. Here’s what actually works in 2026 — not what some affiliate blog in California thinks works.\nWhy You Actually Need a VPN in Iraq Let’s be specific about the problems:\nGovernment-imposed shutdowns. Iraq’s Communications and Media Commission regularly orders ISPs to block platforms. During national exams, the entire internet can go down — but a VPN connected before the shutdown sometimes keeps working on mobile data.\nGeo-restricted services. Many SaaS tools, streaming platforms, and financial services either don’t operate in Iraq or serve a limited version. A VPN with a US or UK server gives you the full experience.\nPublic Wi-Fi security. If you work from cafes in Erbil’s Ankawa district or co-working spaces in Sulaymaniyah, your traffic is exposed. A VPN encrypts everything between your device and the server.\nFreelancer essentials. Some client communication tools, development resources, and payment platforms work inconsistently without a VPN. If your livelihood depends on Slack, GitHub, or Stripe — you need a backup plan.\nWhat Makes a VPN Good for Iraq Specifically Not all VPNs are equal for this region. Here’s what matters:\nServer proximity. Servers in Turkey, UAE, or Jordan give better speeds than connecting to the US. Look for providers with Middle East presence. Obfuscation. During heavy blocking, standard VPN protocols get detected and blocked. You need a provider that can disguise VPN traffic as regular HTTPS. Mobile performance. Most internet usage in Iraq is mobile. The VPN needs lightweight apps that don’t destroy your battery or data allowance. Kill switch reliability. If the VPN drops, your real IP gets exposed. This matters if you’re accessing sensitive work resources. The VPNs That Actually Work Here 1. NordVPN — Best Overall for Iraq NordVPN has been the most consistently reliable VPN I’ve used from Kurdistan. Their obfuscated server technology is crucial — during the January 2026 exam shutdowns, NordVPN’s obfuscated servers were among the few that kept working on Asiacell and Korek mobile data.\nWhat works well:\nObfuscated servers specifically designed for restrictive regions Servers in Turkey (Istanbul), UAE (Dubai), and nearby countries The NordLynx protocol delivers surprisingly good speeds even on Iraq’s infrastructure — I averaged 35-40 Mbps on a 50 Mbps Newroz fiber connection through Istanbul servers Threat Protection feature blocks ads and malware, which matters when many local sites are riddled with aggressive popups Meshnet feature lets you route traffic through a friend’s device abroad — useful as a backup during heavy censorship periods Pricing: Around $3.39/month on the 2-year plan. They frequently run promotions that bring it lower.\nThe catch: The desktop app can be heavy on older hardware. If you’re running a budget laptop, use the browser extension instead for a lighter footprint.\n2. Surfshark — Best Budget Option Surfshark offers unlimited simultaneous connections — meaning one subscription covers your phone, laptop, tablet, and your entire family’s devices. In Iraq, where multiple family members often share one subscription, this is a genuine advantage.\nWhat works well:\nUnlimited devices on one account CleanWeb feature blocks ads effectively Camouflage Mode (their obfuscation) works during moderate blocking periods Decent speeds through Turkey and UAE servers — around 25-30 Mbps on the same connection Pricing: Often under $2.50/month on long-term plans, making it the cheapest reliable option.\nThe catch: During the heaviest blocking periods (full internet shutdowns), Surfshark’s obfuscation doesn’t punch through as reliably as NordVPN’s. It’s excellent 90% of the time, but NordVPN wins in the worst conditions.\n3. ExpressVPN — Best for Streaming and Speed ExpressVPN is the fastest VPN I’ve tested from Iraq, consistently hitting 40-45 Mbps through their servers. Their Lightway protocol is genuinely impressive on mobile.\nWhat works well:\nFastest speeds of any VPN tested from Kurdistan Excellent for streaming — Netflix US, BBC iPlayer, and Disney+ all work reliably Very polished apps across all platforms Strong track record with independent security audits Pricing: Around $6.67/month on the annual plan — significantly more expensive than the others.\nThe catch: You’re paying a premium. For most people in Iraq, the speed difference between ExpressVPN and NordVPN doesn’t justify nearly double the price. But if streaming is your primary use case, it’s worth considering.\n4. Mullvad VPN — Best for Privacy Purists Mullvad takes a different approach: no email required to sign up, accepts cash payments by mail, and costs a flat €5/month with no long-term commitment tricks. If privacy is your primary concern rather than bypassing geo-restrictions, Mullvad is the gold standard.\nWhat works well:\nNo personal information required — just a generated account number Accepts cryptocurrency and even cash WireGuard protocol delivers good speeds Transparent company with regular security audits The catch: Limited server network compared to NordVPN or ExpressVPN. No dedicated obfuscation for heavy censorship periods. No streaming optimization. It’s a focused tool, not an all-in-one solution.\n5. Proton VPN — Best Free Tier If you’re not ready to pay, Proton VPN offers the only free tier I’d actually recommend. No data limits, no ads, and the company has a strong privacy reputation. The free tier gives you servers in the US, Netherlands, and Japan.\nWhat works well:\nGenuinely usable free tier with no data caps Based in Switzerland — strong privacy jurisdiction Open-source apps that have been independently audited Stealth protocol works during moderate blocking The catch: Free servers are slow — expect 5-10 Mbps at best, and you’ll be sharing with many other free users. The paid plans ($4.99/month) are competitive but not exceptional. Consider it a trial before committing to NordVPN or Surfshark.\nVPNs to Avoid in Iraq Free VPNs from unknown companies. If a VPN is completely free and not from a reputable company like Proton, you are the product. Many free VPNs log your data and sell it. Some inject ads into your browsing. A few are outright malware.\nVPNs without obfuscation. Any VPN that doesn’t offer obfuscated or stealth servers is going to fail you during blocking periods. That eliminates most smaller providers.\nVPNs with only distant servers. If the nearest server is in Germany or the US with nothing in the Middle East region, your speeds will suffer badly on Iraqi internet infrastructure.\nPractical Setup Tips for Iraq Install before you need it. VPN websites themselves often get blocked during shutdowns. Download the apps and set up your account while everything works. Keep the installation files backed up locally.\nConfigure multiple protocols. Set up OpenVPN, WireGuard, and the provider’s proprietary protocol. When one gets blocked, switch to another. Most apps make this a one-tap change in settings.\nEnable auto-connect. Set your VPN to connect automatically when your device starts. This prevents accidental unprotected browsing and ensures you’re always ready if blocking starts suddenly.\nUse mobile data as backup. During internet shutdowns, mobile data sometimes remains partially functional. A VPN over mobile data can sometimes reach servers that landline ISPs have blocked.\nGet a dedicated IP if you freelance. Shared VPN IPs sometimes trigger CAPTCHAs or security alerts on client platforms. NordVPN and others offer dedicated IP addresses for a small extra fee — worth it if you access financial or work platforms daily.\nMy Recommendation For most people in Iraq, NordVPN is the best overall choice. It works during the worst blocking periods, has nearby servers for decent speeds, and the 2-year plan is reasonably priced. If budget is tight, Surfshark gives you 90% of the experience at a lower price with unlimited device connections.\nIf you only need a VPN occasionally and don’t want to commit, start with Proton VPN’s free tier and upgrade when you hit its limitations.\nThe bottom line: in Iraq, a VPN isn’t about hiding anything — it’s about having reliable access to the tools and services you need for work and life. Pick one, set it up properly, and stop worrying about whether tomorrow’s internet will cooperate.\nWhat VPN do you use from Iraq?
