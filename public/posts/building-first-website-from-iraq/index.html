Maybe it’s for your business in Erbil, your freelancing portfolio, a blog, or a project you’ve been thinking about for months. You’ve been putting it off because it seems complicated, expensive, or both.\nIt’s neither. You can have a professional website live on the internet today, built entirely from Iraq, for under $50 for the first year. This guide walks you through every step.\nBefore You Start: What You Need A laptop or desktop computer (phone won’t work well for this) Stable internet connection (doesn’t need to be fast — 5 Mbps is enough) A credit/debit card or Payoneer card for purchasing hosting and domain About 3-4 hours of uninterrupted time A VPN installed, just in case any services have regional restrictions That’s it. No coding knowledge required for this guide.\nStep 1: Choose Your Domain Name Your domain name is your website’s address — like talent.krd or google.com.\nTips for choosing well:\nKeep it short and memorable Avoid hyphens and numbers Make it easy to spell when spoken aloud Check that it’s not trademarked Domain extensions for Iraq:\n.com — universal, professional, best for most purposes .krd — specific to Kurdistan. Great for local businesses and projects targeting Kurdish audience. Shows local identity. .iq — Iraq’s country code. Good for businesses targeting all of Iraq. .net / .org — alternatives if .com is taken Where to register:\nNamecheap — reliable, affordable ($8-12/year for .com), easy to use. They accept Payoneer Mastercard. Cloudflare Registrar — sells domains at cost (no markup). If you know you want Cloudflare’s other services, this is the cheapest option. For .krd domains, check the KRD registry at nic.krd. Pricing varies but typically $25-50/year. Action step: Go to Namecheap.com, search for your desired domain name, and purchase it. Choose just the domain — decline the upsells for email, hosting, and other add-ons for now.\nStep 2: Get Web Hosting Hosting is where your website’s files live — a computer (server) that’s always connected to the internet, serving your site to visitors.\nRecommended hosting for beginners from Iraq:\nOption A: Hostinger (Best for beginners)\nStarts at around $2.99/month on annual plans One-click WordPress installation Free SSL certificate (the padlock icon that shows your site is secure) Data centers in multiple regions — choose a European server for good speed to Middle East visitors Accepts Payoneer Mastercard for payment Option B: Cloudflare Pages (Best free option)\nCompletely free for static websites Extremely fast global delivery No traditional hosting management needed Best for portfolio sites and blogs using static site generators More technical to set up — recommended if you’re comfortable with basic command-line tools Option C: Netlify (Best for developers)\nFree tier is generous — enough for most personal and small business sites Automatic HTTPS Great for sites built with Hugo, Next.js, or other modern frameworks Slightly more technical than Hostinger but more powerful For most beginners, go with Hostinger. It’s the path with the least friction.\nAction step: Sign up for Hostinger’s WordPress hosting plan. During setup, connect your domain from Step 1 (they’ll walk you through changing your nameservers at Namecheap).\nStep 3: Install WordPress If you chose Hostinger, WordPress installation is nearly automatic:\nLog into your Hostinger dashboard Click “Websites” → “Create or migrate a website” Select “WordPress” Choose your domain from the dropdown Set your admin username and password (use something strong — not “admin/password123”) Click “Install” WordPress installs in about 2 minutes. You’ll get a notification when it’s ready.\nWhy WordPress? It powers over 40% of all websites on the internet. It’s free, has thousands of themes and plugins, and you’ll never outgrow it. Whether you’re building a simple blog or eventually an e-commerce store, WordPress can handle it.\nStep 4: Choose and Install a Theme Your theme controls how your website looks. WordPress comes with a default theme, but you’ll want something more professional.\nFree themes I recommend:\nAstra — lightweight, fast, works with any type of site. The free version is genuinely good. GeneratePress — minimal and fast. Developers love it, but it’s also very beginner-friendly. OceanWP — feature-rich free theme with many demo sites you can import with one click. How to install a theme:\nIn your WordPress dashboard, go to Appearance → Themes → Add New Search for “Astra” (or your chosen theme) Click Install, then Activate Customizing your theme:\nGo to Appearance → Customize Here you can change colors, fonts, logo, header layout, and more Click Publish when you’re happy with the look Tip: Don’t spend three days picking the perfect theme. Pick one, get your content up, and refine later. A live website with decent design beats a perfect website that’s never launched.\nStep 5: Install Essential Plugins Plugins add functionality to WordPress. Install these basics:\nYoast SEO or Rank Math — helps your site appear in Google search results. Walks you through optimizing each page. WPForms Lite — adds a contact form so visitors can reach you. UpdraftPlus — automatic backups of your website. Critical — don’t skip this. Wordfence or Sucuri — security plugins that protect against common attacks. WP Super Cache or LiteSpeed Cache — makes your site load faster. How to install plugins:\nGo to Plugins → Add New Search for the plugin name Click Install Now, then Activate Important: Only install plugins you actually need. Each plugin adds weight to your site. Five to ten plugins is a healthy range for most sites.\nStep 6: Create Your Core Pages Every website needs these pages at minimum:\nHome Page\nClear statement of what your business/project does Call to action (contact you, browse services, read blog) Keep it focused — visitors decide in 3 seconds whether to stay About Page\nWho you are and why visitors should trust you Your story, experience, and what makes you different A photo of you or your team (builds trust significantly) Contact Page\nContact form (using WPForms) Email address Phone number if appropriate Physical address for local businesses Social media links Services or Portfolio Page (if applicable)\nWhat you offer with clear descriptions Pricing if you’re comfortable sharing it Examples of past work To create a page:\nGo to Pages → Add New Give it a title Add your content using the block editor (it’s drag-and-drop, very intuitive) Click Publish Setting your home page:\nGo to Settings → Reading Select “A static page” Choose your home page from the dropdown If you have a blog section, set the “Posts page” to a page called “Blog” Save changes Step 7: Set Up SSL (HTTPS) SSL encrypts the connection between your visitors and your website. It’s the difference between http:// and https://. Google penalizes sites without SSL, and browsers show scary “Not Secure” warnings.\nIf you’re on Hostinger, SSL is usually enabled automatically. To verify:\nGo to your Hostinger dashboard → SSL Ensure SSL is active for your domain Visit your site — you should see the padlock icon in the browser address bar If it’s not active, click “Install SSL” and wait a few minutes.\nStep 8: Basic SEO Setup So Google can actually find your site:\nInstall Yoast SEO or Rank Math (from Step 5) Run through the setup wizard — it configures basic SEO settings Go to Settings → Reading and make sure “Discourage search engines from indexing this site” is unchecked Submit your sitemap to Google Search Console: Go to search.google.com/search-console Add your domain Verify ownership (Yoast/Rank Math provides instructions) Submit your sitemap URL (usually yourdomain.com/sitemap_index.xml) Important: Google takes days to weeks to start showing your site in search results. Don’t panic if you don’t appear immediately.\nStep 9: Mobile Optimization Check Over 70% of internet usage in Iraq is mobile. Your site must look good on phones.\nOpen your website on your phone Check that text is readable without zooming Check that buttons are easy to tap Check that images aren’t broken or oversized Test the contact form from mobile Most modern WordPress themes are mobile-responsive by default, but always verify.\nStep 10: Launch Checklist Before telling anyone about your site, verify:\nAll pages load without errors Contact form works (send yourself a test message) Site loads with HTTPS (padlock icon visible) Site looks good on mobile All links work (no broken links) You’ve set up automatic backups (UpdraftPlus) You’ve changed the default “Just another WordPress site” tagline in Settings → General What It Costs: Honest Breakdown Item Annual Cost Domain (.com on Namecheap) $8-12 Hosting (Hostinger basic) $36-48 SSL Certificate Free (included) WordPress Free Theme (Astra free) Free Essential Plugins Free Total First Year $44-60 That’s the real cost. Anyone telling you a basic website needs to cost $500+ is either overcharging or overcomplicating things.\nAfter Launch: What’s Next Week 1: Share your site with friends, family, and professional contacts. Post it on social media. Add it to your email signature.\nMonth 1: Start creating content (blog posts) related to your business or expertise. Google rewards sites that regularly publish useful content.\nMonth 2-3: Learn basic Google Analytics to understand who visits your site and what they look at. This data helps you improve.\nOngoing: Keep WordPress, themes, and plugins updated. Update your content regularly. Respond to contact form submissions promptly.\nCommon Mistakes to Avoid Don’t buy a premium theme before you’ve exhausted free options. Free themes in 2026 are genuinely professional. Premium themes add features you probably don’t need yet.\nDon’t install 20 plugins. More plugins means slower site and more security vulnerabilities. Install only what you need.\nDon’t ignore backups. Iraqi power infrastructure and internet instability mean things can go wrong. UpdraftPlus backing up to Google Drive gives you peace of mind.\nDon’t wait for perfection. Launch with good enough content and improve over time. A live imperfect website beats a perfect website that only exists in your head.\nYou now have everything you need to build and launch a website from Iraq. The tools are the same ones used worldwide, they work from Kurdistan, and the total cost is less than a nice dinner in Erbil. Open your laptop and start.\nBuilt your first website using this guide?

Premium themes add features you probably don&rsquo;t need yet.</p><p><strong>Don&rsquo;t install 20 plugins.</strong> More plugins means slower site and more security vulnerabilities. Install only what you need.</p><p><strong>Don&rsquo;t ignore backups.</strong> Iraqi power infrastructure and internet instability mean things can go wrong. UpdraftPlus backing up to Google Drive gives you peace of mind.</p><p><strong>Don&rsquo;t wait for perfection.</strong> Launch with good enough content and improve over time. A live imperfect website beats a perfect website that only exists in your head.</p><p>You now have everything you need to build and launch a website from Iraq. The tools are the same ones used worldwide, they work from Kurdistan, and the total cost is less than a nice dinner in Erbil.
