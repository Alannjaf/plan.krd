They picture Bali, Lisbon, or maybe Dubai. But here’s what outsiders don’t know: Kurdistan has most of what remote workers actually need — affordable living, decent (and improving) internet, a growing community of tech-savvy professionals, and a timezone that overlaps with both European and Gulf business hours.\nThis guide is for two groups of people:\nKurds and Iraqis who want to work remotely for international companies or clients Anyone who’s considering Kurdistan as a base for remote work I’ll cover everything — from practical infrastructure to the cultural dynamics that affect how you work. No sugarcoating.\nInternet: The Real Situation in 2026 Let’s start with the question everyone asks: is the internet good enough?\nThe honest answer: It depends on where you are and how much you’re willing to spend.\nHome internet Fiber optic is now available in most of central Erbil, parts of Sulaymaniyah, and expanding into Duhok. Providers like Newroz Telecom, IQ Networks, and FastLink offer packages ranging from 20 Mbps to 200 Mbps.\nTypical costs:\n20-30 Mbps: $30-50/month 50-100 Mbps: $60-90/month 100-200 Mbps: $90-150/month Reality check: Advertised speeds and actual speeds aren’t always the same. During peak hours (evenings), you might see 60-70% of your advertised speed. For video calls and regular remote work, a 50 Mbps fiber connection handles everything fine.\nBackup plan: Always have a mobile data backup. Korek or Asia Cell 4G/LTE works as a decent fallback. Get an unlimited data plan ($15-25/month) and keep your phone hotspot ready.\nPower outages Power cuts still happen in parts of Iraq, including Kurdistan. If you’re doing remote work seriously:\nGet a UPS (uninterruptible power supply) for your router and laptop — costs $50-100 and gives you 30-60 minutes of backup If your area has frequent cuts, a small generator or solar backup system is worth the investment Co-working spaces (covered below) have backup generators, which is one reason they’re popular with remote workers Co-Working Spaces Kurdistan’s co-working scene has grown significantly. Here are the notable options:\nErbil The Station — The most established co-working space in Erbil. Good internet, meeting rooms, and a community of freelancers and startup founders. Monthly hot desk packages are reasonable.\nStartup Erbil / KAPITA — More startup-focused but open to freelancers. Occasional events and networking opportunities.\nCafes that work: Some cafes in Erbil have quietly become remote work hubs. Look for ones near Ankawa or the Citadel area that have reliable WiFi, power outlets, and don’t mind you staying for hours. Ask around in local tech groups for current recommendations — they change frequently.\nSulaymaniyah Sulaymaniyah arguably has a better vibe for remote work than Erbil. It’s cheaper, more walkable, and has a stronger cultural/creative scene.\nKESK Coworking — Purpose-built co-working with good internet and a community feel.\nChai Khana culture: Sulaymaniyah’s café culture means there are dozens of spots where you can work comfortably. The city’s more relaxed pace suits remote work well.\nDuhok Duhok’s co-working scene is smaller but growing. Check local Facebook groups for current options, as new spaces open regularly.\nWhat to look for in a co-working space: Internet speed (ask for a speed test before committing) Backup generator for power cuts Quiet zones for video calls Monthly vs. daily pricing Community events (networking matters) Setting Up Legally This section is important and often overlooked.\nFor Iraqis working remotely for foreign companies: There’s currently no specific legal framework in Iraq for “remote workers employed by foreign companies.” In practice, most Iraqi remote workers operate as independent contractors or freelancers. Here’s what you should know:\nIncome tax: Iraq has income tax laws, but enforcement for individual freelancers receiving international payments varies. Keep records of your income regardless. As the digital economy grows, regulation will likely tighten. Business registration: You don’t strictly need a registered business to freelance, but having one (even a simple sole proprietorship) adds legitimacy and can help with banking. Banking: Open a bank account that can receive international transfers. FIB (First Iraq Bank) and some KRG banks handle this. Having a Payoneer account connected to a local bank gives you the most flexibility. For foreigners working remotely from Kurdistan: Visa: The Kurdistan Region offers visa-on-arrival for many nationalities (15-30 day tourist visa). For longer stays, you’ll need to arrange a residency permit through a local sponsor. There’s no digital nomad visa (as of early 2026). You’d be working on a tourist visa, which is technically a gray area. Many digital nomads do this, but be aware of the legal ambiguity. Cost of living: Significantly lower than Dubai, Istanbul, or European cities. A comfortable life in Erbil costs $800-1,500/month including rent, food, and transportation. Sulaymaniyah is even cheaper. Finding Remote Jobs from Kurdistan The biggest challenge isn’t infrastructure — it’s getting hired. Here’s what works:\nRemote job platforms General remote jobs:\nWe Work Remotely (weworkremotely.com) Remote OK (remoteok.com) FlexJobs (flexjobs.com) LinkedIn Remote Jobs filter Freelancing platforms:\nUpwork (best for ongoing client relationships) Fiverr (best for productized services) Toptal (for experienced developers and designers — harder to get in, but higher pay) Tech-specific:\nAngelList / Wellfound (startup jobs) Arc.dev (remote developer jobs) Gun.io (freelance developer network) The timezone advantage Kurdistan’s timezone (GMT+3) is one of its biggest selling points for remote work. You overlap with:\nEurope (GMT+0 to GMT+2): Full overlap during standard business hours. European companies love hiring in nearby timezones. Gulf states (GMT+3 to GMT+4): Perfect overlap. Dubai, Riyadh, and Doha are major clients. US East Coast (GMT-5): 8-hour difference. You can overlap for afternoon meetings (their morning). When you apply for remote jobs, mention your timezone overlap explicitly. Something like: “Based in Kurdistan (GMT+3), with full overlap with European business hours and partial overlap with US East Coast.”\nBuilding your professional presence Remote hiring relies heavily on your online presence. Invest time in:\nLinkedIn: Post regularly about your work. Share insights from your field. Engage with content from companies you’d like to work for. Recruiters actively search LinkedIn for remote talent.\nGitHub (for developers): Contribute to open source. Keep your repositories clean and documented. A strong GitHub profile is worth more than a certificate.\nPortfolio website: Even a simple one-page site with your best work, a brief bio, and contact information. Use your .krd domain if you have one.\nTwitter/X: Tech Twitter is still where a lot of professional conversations happen. Build your presence there.\nDay-to-Day Realities of Remote Work from Kurdistan Communication and culture Working with international teams from Kurdistan means navigating cultural differences:\nOver-communicate: In remote work, visibility equals credibility. Share progress updates, ask questions early, and don’t disappear. This is especially important when you’re in a timezone your team isn’t familiar with. Be proactive about scheduling: Don’t make your team figure out when you’re available. Put your working hours in your Slack profile, calendar, and email signature. Camera on for important meetings: This builds trust faster than anything else, especially early in a new role. Written communication matters: Most remote work happens asynchronously through written messages. Invest in writing clearly and concisely in English. Managing isolation Remote work can be lonely, especially in a region where the concept is still relatively new. Your friends and family might not fully understand what you do.\nWhat helps:\nJoin or create a local community of remote workers (check Facebook groups, Telegram channels) Use co-working spaces at least 2-3 days a week for social interaction Attend local tech meetups and events (Startup Weekend, hackathons, tech talks) Set clear boundaries between work and personal time — when you work from home, it’s easy to never stop working Health and routine Working from home in Kurdistan comes with specific challenges:\nSet a schedule: The flexibility of remote work is great until you realize you’ve been working until 2 AM every night. Set working hours and stick to them. Get out of the house: Kurdistan’s outdoor culture is a gift. Walk in the parks, have lunch at a restaurant, exercise. Don’t become a hermit. Set up a proper workspace: A dedicated desk, a decent chair, and good lighting. Don’t work from your bed or sofa — your back will thank you. Financial Considerations How much can you earn? Remote salaries vary enormously by role, experience, and employer:\nJunior developer/designer: $500-1,500/month Mid-level developer/designer: $1,500-4,000/month Senior developer: $3,000-8,000/month Freelance rates: Highly variable. From $15/hr starting out to $100+/hr for specialized senior work Even at the lower end, these numbers compare favorably to most local salaries in Kurdistan, especially when you factor in the flexibility and growth potential.\nBanking and payments This is covered in detail in our freelancing guide, but the short version:\nPayoneer for receiving freelance payments Wise for direct bank transfers from European employers Local banks (FIB, RT Bank) for holding USD and receiving wires Keep a portion of savings in USD to hedge against IQD fluctuations The Bigger Picture Kurdistan is at an inflection point. The traditional economy — oil, government jobs, brick-and-mortar businesses — isn’t creating enough opportunities for the young, educated population. Remote work and freelancing aren’t just nice alternatives. For many, they’re the most realistic path to meaningful income and career growth.\nThe infrastructure isn’t perfect. The legal frameworks are still catching up. But the fundamentals are there: talented people, improving connectivity, a strategic timezone, and a cost of living that lets you save money even on modest international earnings.\nIf you’re reading this from Erbil, Sulaymaniyah, Duhok, or anywhere in the Kurdistan Region — the opportunity is real. The tools are available. The only question is whether you’ll start.\nBuilding a remote career from Kurdistan? We’d love to hear your story.

A strong GitHub profile is worth more than a certificate.</p></li><li><p><strong>Portfolio website:</strong> Even a simple one-page site with your best work, a brief bio, and contact information. Use your .krd domain if you have one.</p></li><li><p><strong>Twitter/X:</strong> Tech Twitter is still where a lot of professional conversations happen. Build your presence there.</p></li></ol><h2 id=day-to-day-realities-of-remote-work-from-kurdistan>Day-to-Day Realities of Remote Work from Kurdistan<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#day-to-day-realities-of-remote-work-from-kurdistan>#</a></h2><h3 id=communication-and-culture>Communication and culture<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#communication-and-culture>#</a></h3><p>Working with international teams from Kurdistan means navigating cultural differences:</p><ul><li><strong>Over-communicate:</strong> In remote work, visibility equals credibility. Share progress updates, ask questions early, and don&rsquo;t disappear. This is especially important when you&rsquo;re in a timezone your team isn&rsquo;t familiar with.</li><li><strong>Be proactive about scheduling:</strong> Don&rsquo;t make your team figure out when you&rsquo;re available. Put your working hours in your Slack profile, calendar, and email signature.</li><li><strong>Camera on for important meetings:</strong> This builds trust faster than anything else, especially early in a new role.</li><li><strong>Written communication matters:</strong> Most remote work happens asynchronously through written messages. Invest in writing clearly and concisely in English.</li></ul><h3 id=managing-isolation>Managing isolation<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#managing-isolation>#</a></h3><p>Remote work can be lonely, especially in a region where the concept is still relatively new. Your friends and family might not fully understand what you do.</p><p><strong>What helps:</strong></p><ul><li>Join or create a local community of remote workers (check Facebook groups, Telegram channels)</li><li>Use co-working spaces at least 2-3 days a week for social interaction</li><li>Attend local tech meetups and events (Startup Weekend, hackathons, tech talks)</li><li>Set clear boundaries between work and personal time — when you work from home, it&rsquo;s easy to never stop working</li></ul><h3 id=health-and-routine>Health and routine<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#health-and-routine>#</a></h3><p>Working from home in Kurdistan comes with specific challenges:</p><ul><li><strong>Set a schedule:</strong> The flexibility of remote work is great until you realize you&rsquo;ve been working until 2 AM every night. Set working hours and stick to them.</li><li><strong>Get out of the house:</strong> Kurdistan&rsquo;s outdoor culture is a gift. Walk in the parks, have lunch at a restaurant, exercise. Don&rsquo;t become a hermit.</li><li><strong>Set up a proper workspace:</strong> A dedicated desk, a decent chair, and good lighting. Don&rsquo;t work from your bed or sofa — your back will thank you.</li></ul><h2 id=financial-considerations>Financial Considerations<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#financial-considerations>#</a></h2><h3 id=how-much-can-you-earn>How much can you earn?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#how-much-can-you-earn>#</a></h3><p>Remote salaries vary enormously by role, experience, and employer:</p><ul><li><strong>Junior developer/designer:</strong> $500-1,500/month</li><li><strong>Mid-level developer/designer:</strong> $1,500-4,000/month</li><li><strong>Senior developer:</strong> $3,000-8,000/month</li><li><strong>Freelance rates:</strong> Highly variable. From $15/hr starting out to $100+/hr for specialized senior work</li></ul><p>Even at the lower end, these numbers compare favorably to most local salaries in Kurdistan, especially when you factor in the flexibility and growth potential.</p><h3 id=banking-and-payments>Banking and payments<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#banking-and-payments>#</a></h3><p>This is covered in detail in our <a href=/posts/how-to-start-freelancing-from-iraq-2026/>freelancing guide</a>, but the short version:</p><ul><li><strong>Payoneer</strong> for receiving freelance payments</li><li><strong>Wise</strong> for direct bank transfers from European employers</li><li><strong>Local banks</strong> (FIB, RT Bank) for holding USD and receiving wires</li><li>Keep a portion of savings in USD to hedge against IQD fluctuations</li></ul><h2 id=the-bigger-picture>The Bigger Picture<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-bigger-picture>#</a></h2><p>Kurdistan is at an inflection point. The traditional economy — oil, government jobs, brick-and-mortar businesses — isn&rsquo;t creating enough opportunities for the young, educated population. Remote work and freelancing aren&rsquo;t just nice alternatives. For many, they&rsquo;re the most realistic path to meaningful income and career growth.</p><p>The infrastructure isn&rsquo;t perfect. The legal frameworks are still catching up. But the fundamentals are there: talented people, improving connectivity, a strategic timezone, and a cost of living that lets you save money even on modest international earnings.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re reading this from Erbil, Sulaymaniyah, Duhok, or anywhere in the Kurdistan Region — the opportunity is real. The tools are available. The only question is whether you&rsquo;ll start.</p><hr><p><em>Building a remote career from Kurdistan? We&rsquo;d love to hear your story.
