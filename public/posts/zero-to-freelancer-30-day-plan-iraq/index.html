This guide is different. It’s a specific, day-by-day plan for someone in Iraq who wants to start freelancing but has never done it before.\nAt the end of 30 days, you’ll have active profiles on freelancing platforms, a portfolio, your first proposals sent, and — if you follow the plan seriously — your first paid client or project.\nThis plan assumes you have a marketable skill or are willing to start with accessible skills like writing, data entry, virtual assistance, or basic design. If you need to learn a skill first, see our guide on in-demand skills you can learn for free.\nWeek 1: Foundation (Days 1-7) Day 1: Define Your Service Don’t try to be everything. Pick ONE specific service you can offer. Not “I do web development,” but “I build WordPress websites for small businesses.” Not “I’m a writer,” but “I write blog posts about technology in English.”\nAction items:\nWrite down 3 skills you have (even basic ones count) For each skill, write what specific service you could offer Pick the one where you’re most confident you can deliver quality work Write a one-sentence description: “I help [who] with [what] so they can [benefit]” Day 2: Research the Market Action items:\nGo to Fiverr.com and search for your service. Study the top-rated sellers: What do their gig titles say? How do they describe their services? What’s their pricing structure? What do their reviews praise? Go to Upwork.com and search for jobs matching your skill: What are clients asking for? What budget ranges do you see? What skills are listed as required? Write down 5 things you learned about what clients want Day 3: Set Up Your Payment Method Don’t skip this — the biggest beginner mistake is landing a job and then scrambling to figure out how to get paid.\nAction items:\nCreate a Payoneer account (payoneer.com) — this is how you’ll receive money from most platforms Upload your ID for verification (takes 2-3 business days) While waiting, ensure you have a working email address that sounds professional (firstname.lastname@gmail.com, not coolgamer99@hotmail.com) Day 4: Create Sample Work You need proof you can do what you claim, even without past clients.\nAction items for different skills:\nIf you’re a writer:\nWrite 2 sample blog posts (600-800 words each) on topics relevant to your target market Publish them on Medium.com (free) as your portfolio pieces If you’re a designer:\nCreate 3 sample designs (logos, social media templates, or whatever your service is) Use real-looking but clearly fictional brand names Save them as high-quality images If you’re a developer:\nBuild 2 small demo projects (a landing page, a simple web app) Deploy them for free on Netlify or GitHub Pages Document what you built and why If you’re a virtual assistant:\nCreate a document showcasing your organizational skills: a sample content calendar, a travel itinerary plan, or a research summary Demonstrate specific tools you know: Google Workspace, Notion, Trello Day 5: Build a Simple Portfolio Action items:\nCreate a free portfolio using one of these: Notion (notion.so) — create a public page showcasing your work. Free and looks professional. Carrd (carrd.co) — $19/year for a simple one-page portfolio site. WordPress.com — free tier works for a basic portfolio blog. Include: your name, one professional photo, your service description, 2-3 sample works, and contact information Get the URL — this goes on all your freelancing profiles Day 6: Create Your Fiverr Profile Fiverr is the easiest platform to start on. Clients come to you.\nAction items:\nSign up on Fiverr.com Complete your profile: Professional photo (no selfies — get someone to take a proper headshot) Description: who you are, what you do, why you’re good at it. Be specific. Skills: add all relevant skills Languages: list English (and Arabic/Kurdish if relevant to your service) Education and certifications Create your first gig: Title: be specific and keyword-rich (“I Will Write SEO Blog Posts for Tech Companies” not “I Will Write”) Description: explain exactly what the client gets, your process, and delivery timeline Pricing: start competitive. Your first gig should be priced 20-30% below established sellers. You’re buying reviews, not maximizing profit yet. Set 3 packages (Basic, Standard, Premium) with clear differences Add your sample work as gig images and portfolio items Day 7: Create Your Upwork Profile Upwork takes more effort but has higher-paying clients.\nAction items:\nSign up on Upwork.com (approval can take a few days — that’s normal) Complete your profile thoroughly: Title: “Service | Specific niche | Value proposition” (e.g., “WordPress Developer | Small Business Websites | Fast \u0026 Reliable”) Overview: 3-4 paragraphs. Start with what you do for clients (not about yourself). Include specific skills and tools. End with a call to action. Hourly rate: start at $10-15/hour for most skills from Iraq. This is competitive for the platform while still respecting your time. Portfolio: upload your sample work Skills: add all relevant ones Employment history: include any relevant experience, even if not freelancing Take Upwork’s skill tests if available for your area — they boost your profile visibility Week 2: Outreach (Days 8-14) Day 8: Learn How to Write Proposals The proposal is where most beginners fail. They send generic, copy-pasted messages. Don’t be them.\nA good Upwork proposal has:\nAcknowledgment — show you read the job post. Reference something specific. Relevance — explain why your experience matches this specific job. Solution — briefly outline how you’d approach the work. Proof — link to relevant sample work. Question — ask something specific about the project. This shows engagement and starts a conversation. Example:\nHi [name], I noticed you need blog posts about cybersecurity for small businesses. I’ve written similar content — here’s a recent piece on [topic] that got [result/positive feedback].\nFor your project, I’d approach each post by researching current threats relevant to your audience, then structuring the content around actionable steps rather than just scare tactics.\nQuick question: are you targeting a technical audience or business owners who aren’t tech-savvy? This would shape the tone significantly.\nHappy to discuss further. Portfolio: [link]\nDays 9-14: Send Proposals Daily Daily action items (every day for 6 days):\nSpend 30 minutes finding relevant job posts on Upwork Send 3-5 customized proposals per day (quality over quantity) On Fiverr, optimize your gig by responding to any buyer requests in your category Track every proposal in a simple spreadsheet: date, job title, client, status What to bid on:\nJobs posted in the last 24 hours (older jobs likely have many proposals already) Jobs with fewer than 10 proposals Jobs where the client has a verified payment method Jobs that match your skills closely (don’t stretch too far) What to avoid:\n“Need expert in everything” jobs Jobs with budgets under $5 (these clients usually aren’t worth the effort) Jobs that are vague or poorly written (indicates a difficult client) Week 3: Momentum (Days 15-21) Day 15: Expand to Additional Platforms Action items:\nCreate a profile on Freelancer.com — another large marketplace Consider PeoplePerHour — popular for design and development Look into Khamsat (khamsat.com) — Arabic-language freelancing platform, good for Arabic content services For writers: create profiles on Contently and nDash Days 16-17: Network Online Action items:\nJoin 3-5 Facebook groups related to your skill and freelancing (search “freelancing Iraq,” “Kurdish developers,” “Erbil tech”) Join relevant Telegram groups (ask around — Kurdish tech communities are active on Telegram) Join relevant subreddits on Reddit (r/freelance, subreddits for your skill) Don’t spam these groups with self-promotion. Answer questions, help people, share useful information. People notice and reach out to helpful members. Day 18: Create LinkedIn Presence Action items:\nUpdate or create your LinkedIn profile Headline: your freelance title (e.g., “Freelance Web Developer | WordPress Specialist”) Add your portfolio work to the Featured section Write a post about starting your freelancing journey (this gets engagement and visibility) Connect with 20 people in your industry Days 19-21: Continue Proposals + Follow Up Daily action items:\nContinue sending 3-5 proposals per day on Upwork Check Fiverr for buyer requests and respond to any messages Follow up on proposals sent last week that haven’t received a response (a polite one-line follow-up is appropriate after 5-7 days) If you’ve had conversations that didn’t convert to jobs, analyze why. Was it pricing? Skill mismatch? Communication? Week 4: First Client (Days 22-30) Day 22: Evaluate and Adjust Action items:\nReview your proposal success rate. If you’ve sent 30+ proposals with zero responses, something needs to change: Is your pricing competitive? Lower it temporarily. Are your samples relevant to the jobs you’re bidding on? Create more targeted samples. Is your proposal template working? Try a completely different approach. Is your profile complete and professional? Ask someone to review it honestly. Day 23: Try a Different Approach If proposals aren’t working yet:\nOffer a small job at a steep discount or free to get your first review. One 5-star review on Fiverr is worth more than a perfect profile with zero reviews. Look for local clients in Kurdistan. Walk into small businesses and offer to set up their Google Business Profile or create social media posts. Many will say yes because nobody has offered before. Post in freelancer groups that you’re available for small projects at introductory rates. Days 24-28: Execute and Deliver By now, you should have at least one inquiry or small job.\nWhen you get your first job:\nRespond within 2 hours (speed matters enormously on platforms) Clarify requirements before starting work. Ask specific questions. Deliver earlier than promised. If the deadline is 5 days, deliver in 3. Over-deliver slightly. Include a small extra that wasn’t asked for — a bonus revision, an additional format, a helpful suggestion. After delivery, politely ask for a review: “If you’re happy with the work, a positive review would help me grow on this platform. Thank you!” Day 29: Systems and Processes Action items:\nCreate a template for your most common communication (proposal, follow-up, delivery message, review request) Set up a simple tracking system: a spreadsheet with columns for client, project, deadline, payment status, and review status Open a separate bank account or Payoneer sub-account for freelancing income Calculate your effective hourly rate on completed projects. Is it sustainable? Adjust pricing accordingly. Day 30: Plan Month Two Action items:\nReview your 30-day stats: proposals sent, responses received, jobs completed, money earned Set specific goals for month two: income target, number of clients, skill to improve Identify what worked best and double down on it Identify what didn’t work and eliminate it Start thinking about raising your rates — even by a small amount Critical Mindset Adjustments The first month will be slow. You might send 50 proposals and get 2 responses. This is normal. Every successful freelancer on Upwork went through this phase. The platform algorithms reward persistence and completed projects.\nDon’t compete on price alone. It’s tempting to price at $3/hour to get your first job. Don’t. You’ll attract terrible clients and burn out. Price fairly, compete on quality and communication.\nCommunication is half the job. Clients from the US and Europe choose freelancers partly based on English communication skills. Respond quickly, write clearly, and ask good questions. This differentiates you more than technical skill.\nTreat it like a job from day one. Set working hours. Have a dedicated workspace. Track your time. Bill accurately. The freelancers who struggle are the ones who treat it casually.\nIraq-specific challenges are manageable. Yes, payments are more complex. Yes, the internet sometimes goes down. Yes, some clients have preconceptions about hiring from Iraq. None of these are deal-breakers. Thousands of Iraqis freelance successfully — you can too.\nWhat Comes After Day 30 If you’ve followed this plan, you should have:\nActive profiles on 2-3 freelancing platforms At least one completed project (ideally with a positive review) A growing portfolio A functional payment system A clear understanding of what clients want and what you need to improve Month two is about scaling: raising rates, targeting better clients, specializing further, and building repeat business. But that’s a guide for another day.\nThe hardest part of freelancing is day 1. You’ve now got a plan for days 1 through 30. Open your laptop and start.\nGoing through this 30-day plan?

They send generic, copy-pasted messages. Don&rsquo;t be them.</p><p><strong>A good Upwork proposal has:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Acknowledgment</strong> — show you read the job post. Reference something specific.</li><li><strong>Relevance</strong> — explain why your experience matches this specific job.</li><li><strong>Solution</strong> — briefly outline how you&rsquo;d approach the work.</li><li><strong>Proof</strong> — link to relevant sample work.</li><li><strong>Question</strong> — ask something specific about the project. This shows engagement and starts a conversation.</li></ol><p><strong>Example:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Hi [name], I noticed you need blog posts about cybersecurity for small businesses. I&rsquo;ve written similar content — here&rsquo;s a recent piece on [topic] that got [result/positive feedback].</p><p>For your project, I&rsquo;d approach each post by researching current threats relevant to your audience, then structuring the content around actionable steps rather than just scare tactics.</p><p>Quick question: are you targeting a technical audience or business owners who aren&rsquo;t tech-savvy? This would shape the tone significantly.</p><p>Happy to discuss further.

This is normal. Every successful freelancer on Upwork went through this phase. The platform algorithms reward persistence and completed projects.</p><p><strong>Don&rsquo;t compete on price alone.</strong> It&rsquo;s tempting to price at $3/hour to get your first job. Don&rsquo;t. You&rsquo;ll attract terrible clients and burn out. Price fairly, compete on quality and communication.</p><p><strong>Communication is half the job.</strong> Clients from the US and Europe choose freelancers partly based on English communication skills. Respond quickly, write clearly, and ask good questions. This differentiates you more than technical skill.</p><p><strong>Treat it like a job from day one.</strong> Set working hours. Have a dedicated workspace. Track your time. Bill accurately. The freelancers who struggle are the ones who treat it casually.</p><p><strong>Iraq-specific challenges are manageable.</strong> Yes, payments are more complex. Yes, the internet sometimes goes down. Yes, some clients have preconceptions about hiring from Iraq. None of these are deal-breakers. Thousands of Iraqis freelance successfully — you can too.</p><h2 id=what-comes-after-day-30>What Comes After Day 30<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#what-comes-after-day-30>#</a></h2><p>If you&rsquo;ve followed this plan, you should have:</p><ul><li>Active profiles on 2-3 freelancing platforms</li><li>At least one completed project (ideally with a positive review)</li><li>A growing portfolio</li><li>A functional payment system</li><li>A clear understanding of what clients want and what you need to improve</li></ul><p>Month two is about scaling: raising rates, targeting better clients, specializing further, and building repeat business.
