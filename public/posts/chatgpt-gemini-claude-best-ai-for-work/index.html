Most of those opinions come from people who tried one of them once, got a weird answer, and declared the whole thing overhyped — or got one good answer and declared it the future of humanity.\nThe reality is more nuanced and more useful. I’ve used ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and Anthropic’s Claude daily for the past year across writing, coding, research, and business tasks. Here’s what each one actually excels at, where each one fails, and which one you should use for specific work tasks.\nThe Three Contenders in Early 2026 ChatGPT (OpenAI) — The most well-known AI assistant. Available through chat.openai.com and a mobile app. Free tier available; ChatGPT Plus costs $20/month for GPT-4o and advanced features.\nGemini (Google) — Google’s AI assistant, integrated across Google Workspace. Free tier through gemini.google.com; Gemini Advanced ($20/month) gives access to the most capable models and deeper Google integration.\nClaude (Anthropic) — Anthropic’s AI assistant at claude.ai. Free tier available; Claude Pro costs $20/month for the most capable Claude models and higher usage limits.\nAll three have reached a level where they’re genuinely useful for work. The differences are in personality, strengths, and how they handle specific tasks.\nHead-to-Head: Real Work Tasks Writing and Editing Task: Draft a professional email to a client explaining a project delay, write a blog post introduction, edit a report for clarity.\nChatGPT: Strong at generating drafts quickly. Tends toward a slightly formal, corporate tone. Good at following specific tone instructions (“write this casually” or “make this more formal”). Sometimes adds unnecessary filler phrases — you’ll find yourself deleting “In today’s fast-paced world” more than you’d like.\nGemini: Slightly more natural writing style than ChatGPT. Excels at shorter formats — emails, social media posts, product descriptions. Can sometimes be verbose for longer pieces. Strong integration with Google Docs means you can edit directly in your document.\nClaude: The strongest writer of the three for longer-form content. Produces the most natural, human-sounding text. Better at maintaining a consistent voice across a long document. Less likely to use cliché business phrases. When asked to edit your writing, Claude tends to preserve your voice rather than replacing it with its own.\nWinner for writing: Claude for long-form and nuanced writing. ChatGPT for quick drafts and email templates. Gemini for Google Workspace integration.\nCoding and Technical Tasks Task: Debug a Python script, explain a code concept, generate a function from a description, review code for issues.\nChatGPT: Very strong at coding across many languages. GPT-4o handles complex multi-file problems well. The code interpreter feature lets you run Python code directly, which is excellent for data analysis. Good at explaining code step-by-step.\nGemini: Capable coder, particularly strong with Google-ecosystem technologies (Android, Firebase, Google Cloud). Context window handles large codebases well. Can analyze entire repositories when given access. Slightly less precise than ChatGPT for edge cases.\nClaude: Excellent at code review and explaining why code works a certain way, not just how. Strong at catching subtle bugs. The largest context window of the three means you can paste entire files without truncation issues. Claude tends to be more careful about suggesting code that might have security implications, which is both a feature and sometimes an annoyance when you want quick-and-dirty solutions.\nWinner for coding: ChatGPT for breadth and code execution. Claude for code review and understanding complex codebases. Gemini for Google-stack development.\nResearch and Analysis Task: Summarize a long document, analyze data, compare options, prepare a market overview.\nChatGPT: With web browsing enabled, ChatGPT can pull current information from the internet. Good at synthesizing multiple sources. The DALL-E integration means it can create charts and visualizations. Sometimes presents uncertain information too confidently.\nGemini: The strongest for research tasks that require current information, thanks to Google Search integration. Can access and summarize web pages, academic papers, and news in real time. The Deep Research feature can autonomously investigate a topic and produce multi-page reports. Particularly useful for market research and competitive analysis.\nClaude: Very strong at analyzing documents you provide. If you upload a PDF, spreadsheet, or long report, Claude will give you the most thorough and careful analysis. Less useful for real-time web research (no built-in search). The large context window means you can upload multiple long documents at once for cross-reference analysis.\nWinner for research: Gemini for web-based current research. Claude for analyzing documents you provide. ChatGPT for a balance of both.\nCreative and Strategic Work Task: Brainstorm business ideas, develop a marketing strategy, create content calendars, write creative copy.\nChatGPT: Good brainstormer, generates lots of ideas quickly. Can sometimes be predictable — the first few suggestions tend to be obvious. Push it harder (“give me unconventional ideas” or “what would a competitor not think of”) to get more creative output.\nGemini: Strong at strategy work, particularly when it can leverage Google’s data. Good at competitive analysis and market positioning. Less creative in pure brainstorming but more grounded in practical reality.\nClaude: The most creative brainstormer in my experience. Claude tends to think more laterally and offers ideas that are genuinely unexpected. Also excellent at playing devil’s advocate — ask Claude to poke holes in your business plan and you’ll get thoughtful, specific critique rather than generic caution.\nWinner for creative work: Claude for brainstorming and strategy critique. ChatGPT for rapid idea generation. Gemini for data-informed strategy.\nAccess and Pricing from Iraq This matters because not all AI services work equally well from the region.\nChatGPT:\nFree tier: Available, works from Iraq (sometimes needs a VPN for signup) Plus ($20/month): Works with international card or Payoneer Mastercard Mobile app: Available on both iOS and Android Accessibility: Most widely accessible of the three Gemini:\nFree tier: Available through Google account Advanced ($20/month): Part of Google One AI Premium plan Integration: Works within Gmail, Docs, Sheets if you have Workspace Accessibility: Works well from Iraq since Google services are generally accessible Claude:\nFree tier: Available at claude.ai, works from Iraq Pro ($20/month): Works with international card Mobile app: Available on iOS and Android Accessibility: Generally accessible from Iraq without VPN Budget recommendation: If you can only afford one paid subscription, choose based on your primary use case. For writing-heavy work, Claude Pro. For coding and general use, ChatGPT Plus. For Google Workspace users who want AI everywhere, Gemini Advanced.\nIf you can’t afford any paid tier, the free versions are still remarkably capable. Claude’s free tier is particularly generous for conversations that don’t require heavy usage.\nThe Honest Limitations None of these tools are perfect. Here’s what they all get wrong:\nHallucinations. All three sometimes generate confident-sounding false information. Gemini is slightly better due to real-time search grounding, but none are fully reliable for factual claims. Always verify important facts.\nRegional knowledge. All three have limited knowledge about Kurdistan and Iraq specifically. They’ll give you generic “Middle East” advice when you need Erbil-specific information. Providing context in your prompts helps: “I’m based in Erbil, Kurdistan Region of Iraq” gets better results than just “I’m in Iraq.”\nArabic and Kurdish language quality. All three support Arabic, but quality varies. Kurdish (Sorani or Kurmanji) support is limited across all platforms. For Kurdish-language content, expect to do significant editing. ChatGPT and Gemini have slightly better Arabic support than Claude, but the gap is narrowing.\nInternet dependency. During Iraq’s internet shutdowns, you lose access to all cloud-based AI tools. There’s no good workaround for this beyond having a VPN ready and hoping mobile data remains partially functional.\nHow to Use AI Effectively for Work Regardless of which tool you choose, these principles apply:\nBe specific in your prompts. “Write me a blog post” gives mediocre results. “Write a 500-word blog post about the challenges of receiving international payments in Iraq, targeting freelancers aged 20-35, in a conversational tone” gives dramatically better results.\nProvide context. Paste relevant background information into your prompt. The more context the AI has, the better the output. This is where Claude’s larger context window is a genuine advantage — you can paste entire documents as context.\nIterate, don’t accept first drafts. The first response is a starting point. Follow up with “make this more concise,” “add specific examples,” or “this section is weak, strengthen it.” AI conversations are most productive after the third or fourth exchange.\nUse AI as a collaborator, not a replacement. The best results come from combining AI’s speed and breadth with your judgment, local knowledge, and expertise. Let AI generate the first draft; you provide the insight, fact-checking, and human perspective.\nTry all three for your specific needs. The free tiers make this easy. Spend a week using each one for your actual work tasks, not toy examples. Your experience may differ from mine based on your specific use case.\nMy Setup For transparency, here’s what I use daily:\nClaude Pro for long-form writing, content editing, and brainstorming. It’s my primary AI tool. ChatGPT Plus for coding tasks, quick questions, and when I need web browsing integration. Gemini (free tier) for quick Google Workspace tasks and when I need real-time information search. If I had to pick one: Claude, because writing and analysis are my most frequent work tasks.\nIf I needed to be practical about budget: ChatGPT Plus, because it’s the most versatile single tool.\nIf I lived in Google’s ecosystem: Gemini Advanced, because the Workspace integration is genuinely productive.\nThe Bottom Line The AI assistant wars are good for users. Competition has driven all three platforms to improve rapidly, and the free tiers are better than the paid tiers were two years ago.\nDon’t get caught up in brand loyalty or tech tribalism. Use whichever tool — or combination of tools — makes your specific work better. The person who uses Claude for writing, ChatGPT for coding, and Gemini for research isn’t being indecisive. They’re being smart.\nTry them. Use the free tiers. Pay for whichever one makes the biggest difference in your daily work. The best AI assistant is the one that saves you the most time on the tasks you actually do.\nWhich AI assistant do you use most from Iraq?

It&rsquo;s my primary AI tool.</li><li><strong>ChatGPT Plus</strong> for coding tasks, quick questions, and when I need web browsing integration.</li><li><strong>Gemini</strong> (free tier) for quick Google Workspace tasks and when I need real-time information search.</li></ul><p>If I had to pick one: Claude, because writing and analysis are my most frequent work tasks.</p><p>If I needed to be practical about budget: ChatGPT Plus, because it&rsquo;s the most versatile single tool.</p><p>If I lived in Google&rsquo;s ecosystem: Gemini Advanced, because the Workspace integration is genuinely productive.</p><h2 id=the-bottom-line>The Bottom Line<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-bottom-line>#</a></h2><p>The AI assistant wars are good for users. Competition has driven all three platforms to improve rapidly, and the free tiers are better than the paid tiers were two years ago.</p><p>Don&rsquo;t get caught up in brand loyalty or tech tribalism. Use whichever tool — or combination of tools — makes your specific work better. The person who uses Claude for writing, ChatGPT for coding, and Gemini for research isn&rsquo;t being indecisive. They&rsquo;re being smart.</p><p>Try them. Use the free tiers. Pay for whichever one makes the biggest difference in your daily work. The best AI assistant is the one that saves you the most time on the tasks you actually do.</p><hr><p><em>Which AI assistant do you use most from Iraq?
