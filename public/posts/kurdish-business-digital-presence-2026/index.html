It’s been open for eight years. If you search for it on Google, you’ll find nothing — no website, no Google Business listing, no menu online. The only way to know it exists is to walk past it or hear about it from someone who has.\nTwo blocks away, a newer restaurant — open for eighteen months — has a Google Business profile with 400+ reviews, an Instagram account with daily posts, an online menu, and a simple website with a reservation form. It’s packed every night.\nThe food quality at both places is comparable. The difference is digital presence. This is not a tech article — it’s a business survival article.\nThe Numbers That Should Concern You Let’s look at how people in Kurdistan find businesses in 2026:\nGoogle Maps is the default way younger Kurds find restaurants, clinics, salons, and shops. If your business isn’t on Google Maps with photos and reviews, you effectively don’t exist for anyone under 35. Instagram is where Erbil’s middle class discovers new brands, cafes, and services. Businesses without Instagram presence are invisible to this demographic. WhatsApp has replaced phone calls for business inquiries. If you don’t have a WhatsApp Business number prominently displayed online, you’re losing customer contacts. Snapchat and TikTok drive foot traffic for retail, food, and entertainment businesses in Kurdistan more than any billboard. This isn’t speculation. Talk to any successful business owner in Erbil or Sulaymaniyah who opened in the last three years, and they’ll tell you: digital channels are where most of their customers come from.\nWhat “Digital Presence” Actually Means It’s not about having a fancy website or going viral on TikTok. For most Kurdish businesses, digital presence is three concrete things:\n1. Google Business Profile (Free and Non-Negotiable) This is the single most impactful thing any local business can do, and it’s completely free.\nWhat it gives you:\nYour business appears on Google Maps Customers can find your phone number, hours, address, and photos Reviews build social proof You appear in “near me” searches (“restaurants near me”, “dentist near me”) How to set it up:\nGo to business.google.com Claim or create your business listing Verify your business (Google sends a postcard or calls your phone) Add photos — businesses with photos get 42% more direction requests Fill in every field: hours, services, description, category Ask your best customers to leave reviews Common mistake: Setting it up and forgetting about it. Post updates weekly — new products, special offers, behind-the-scenes photos. Google rewards active profiles with higher rankings.\nReal impact: A dental clinic in Sulaymaniyah told me they got 15-20 new patient inquiries per month just from their Google Business listing after optimizing it properly. Previously, they relied entirely on referrals.\n2. Social Media (Pick Two Platforms, Do Them Well) You don’t need to be on every platform. Pick two based on your business type:\nFor restaurants, cafes, retail, beauty:\nInstagram (visual products, lifestyle branding) TikTok (short videos, behind-the-scenes, trending sounds) For professional services (legal, medical, consulting):\nInstagram (educational content, client testimonials) LinkedIn (professional networking, B2B leads) For home services, construction, automotive:\nFacebook (still dominant for 35+ demographics in Iraq) Instagram (before/after photos, project showcases) What to post:\nBehind-the-scenes content (people love seeing how things are made/done) Customer testimonials and reviews Before/after transformations Team introductions (people trust faces more than logos) Educational content about your industry Special offers and announcements Posting frequency: 3-5 times per week minimum. Consistency matters more than perfection. A daily smartphone photo of your work beats a monthly professional photoshoot.\nDon’t overthink production quality. The most engaging content from Kurdish businesses I’ve seen is authentic, slightly imperfect content shot on phones. Customers connect with real, not polished.\n3. A Simple Website (Your Digital Storefront) Social media platforms can change their algorithms or shut down. Your website is territory you own and control.\nWhat your website needs:\nWho you are and what you do (clear in 5 seconds) How to contact you (phone, WhatsApp, email, location) Your services or products with descriptions Photos of your work, products, or space Customer testimonials Mobile-friendly design (most visitors will be on phones) What your website does NOT need:\nComplex animations or fancy effects A blog (unless you’ll actually update it) E-commerce capability (unless you’re selling products online) Every service you’ve ever offered A five-page website that loads fast and has a working contact form is worth more than a twenty-page site that’s confusing to navigate.\nCost reality: A basic professional website costs $200-800 if you hire a local developer. You can build one yourself using WordPress for under $60/year (see our website building guide). Either way, it’s less than one month of rent on a billboard.\nThe ROI Conversation Kurdish business owners I talk to often ask: “Will this actually make me money, or is it just a cost?”\nFair question. Here’s how to think about it:\nA Google Business Profile costs $0 and typically generates measurable inquiries within 2-4 weeks.\nSocial media management costs your time (if DIY) or $200-500/month (if you hire someone). A single new customer per month from social media likely covers this cost for most businesses.\nA website costs $200-800 upfront and $50-100/year to maintain. It works 24/7 — answering questions, showing your work, and collecting leads while you sleep. One client acquired through your website pays for years of website costs.\nCompare these costs to traditional advertising in Kurdistan:\nBillboard on a main road in Erbil: $500-2,000/month Print ad in a local magazine: $200-500/issue Radio ad: $300-1,000/month Digital channels cost less, reach more people, are measurable (you know exactly how many people saw your ad), and compound over time (your Google reviews and social media following keep growing).\nReal Examples from Kurdistan Example 1: Erbil Bakery A bakery in Erbil started posting daily Instagram Reels showing bread-making process. Within four months, their Instagram grew to 12,000 followers. They now get 30-40% of new customers from Instagram. Investment: phone camera and 20 minutes per day.\nExample 2: Sulaymaniyah IT Company An IT services company created a simple website, started a blog about common IT problems (in Kurdish and English), and optimized for local search. They now rank #1 for “IT support Sulaymaniyah” and generate 60% of leads through their website. Investment: $600 for website, 2 blog posts per month.\nExample 3: Duhok Real Estate A real estate agency started posting property tours on TikTok and Instagram. Their videos consistently get 10,000-50,000 views. They’ve reduced their spending on traditional advertising by 70% while increasing inquiries. Investment: smartphone with good camera, 1 hour per day.\nHow to Start: A Practical 30-Day Plan Week 1: Google Business Profile\nCreate or claim your listing Add 20+ high-quality photos Write a compelling business description Set accurate hours and contact information Ask 10 loyal customers to leave reviews Week 2: Social Media Foundation\nCreate business accounts on your two chosen platforms Write a clear bio explaining what you do and where Post your first 5 pieces of content Follow and engage with other local businesses Add your social media links everywhere — business cards, receipts, storefront Week 3: Content Rhythm\nEstablish a posting schedule (e.g., Monday, Wednesday, Friday) Batch-create content: take 20 photos on one day, use them throughout the week Respond to every comment and message within 24 hours Start using location tags and local hashtags Week 4: Website Planning\nDecide: build yourself or hire a developer? If hiring: contact 2-3 local developers for quotes If DIY: follow a step-by-step WordPress tutorial and build a basic site Ensure your website links to your social media and vice versa Hiring Help: What to Pay in Kurdistan If you don’t want to manage this yourself — and that’s perfectly reasonable — here’s what these services typically cost in the Kurdistan market:\nSocial media management: $200-600/month (posting, engagement, basic content creation) Website development: $300-1,500 one-time (basic to mid-range business site) Google Ads management: $200-500/month plus ad spend Photography session: $100-300 per session (for product/business photos) Video content creation: $150-500 per video (higher production quality) You can find capable freelancers for these services on Fiverr if you want to explore affordable options, or in local Kurdish tech communities on Facebook and Telegram.\nThe Businesses That Will Struggle In 2026, the businesses in Kurdistan that don’t adapt to digital will face specific consequences:\nYounger customers (18-35) won’t find them — this demographic doesn’t use phone directories or drive around looking for shops They’ll lose competitive advantage to newer businesses that are digital-first They’ll overspend on traditional advertising that’s increasingly less effective They’ll have no data about their customers — no way to know what works and what doesn’t This isn’t about technology for technology’s sake. It’s about meeting your customers where they already are: on their phones, searching Google Maps, scrolling Instagram, watching TikTok.\nThe good news: it’s not too late, the tools are accessible from Iraq, many are free, and the local competition for digital presence is still low enough that early movers gain outsized advantages.\nYour business has survived without digital presence until now. The question is whether it can keep surviving — and growing — without one for the next five years.\nRunning a business in Kurdistan and want specific advice on your digital strategy?
