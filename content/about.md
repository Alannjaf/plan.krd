## We Write the Guides We Wished Existed

Kurdistan has no shortage of talent. Walk through any university in Erbil or Sulaymaniyah and you'll meet students who can code, design, and think circles around their opportunities. The gap isn't ability — it's information.

Most career advice online assumes you live in San Francisco with a Chase bank account and a LinkedIn network full of hiring managers. That's useless if you're in Duhok trying to figure out how to receive your first Upwork payment, or in Baghdad wondering which AI tools actually work without a VPN.

**Talent KRD** exists to close that gap.

## What We Cover

- **Freelancing from Iraq** — real strategies for finding clients, getting paid, and building a sustainable remote career from Kurdistan and beyond
- **AI & Technology** — which tools actually matter for your work, how to use them effectively, and what's coming next
- **Remote Work** — landing international jobs, navigating time zones, and dealing with the realities of working remotely from Iraq (yes, including the power outages)
- **Career Development** — building skills, portfolios, and professional presence that compete globally
- **Local Business** — helping Kurdish businesses build digital presence and reach more customers

## Who We Are

We're tech professionals, freelancers, and writers based in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. We've collectively:

- Freelanced for clients across 15+ countries from our apartments in Erbil
- Navigated every payment method from Payoneer to crypto to hawala
- Built remote careers despite internet shutdowns, power cuts, and family members asking why we aren't getting "real jobs"
- Helped dozens of Kurdish professionals land their first international clients

Everything we write comes from experience, not theory. When we say a VPN works during exam shutdowns, it's because we tested it. When we recommend a payment method, it's because we've used it to receive real money.

## Our Approach

**No fluff.** We don't write 2,000-word articles that could be summarized in one sentence. Every guide has specific, actionable steps.

**Iraq-tested.** Every tool, platform, and strategy we recommend has been tested from Iraqi internet connections, with Iraqi IDs, and Iraqi bank accounts.

**Honest.** If something doesn't work well from Iraq, we say so. If a "free" tool has hidden costs, we mention it. We'd rather be useful than popular.

## Get Involved

**Write for us.** If you're a Kurdish or Iraqi professional with experience worth sharing, we want to hear from you. Guest posts are welcome — reach out with your idea.

**Share your story.** Built a freelancing career from Iraq? Grew a business through digital channels? Your story could inspire someone who's just starting.
