The single biggest frustration for anyone trying to earn money online from Iraq isn't finding work — it's getting paid. You land a client, deliver excellent work, and then spend three days figuring out how to actually receive the money.

PayPal doesn't fully support Iraq. Many banking integrations don't work. Wire transfer fees eat your profits on small jobs. And every "how to get paid online" article assumes you have a US bank account.

This guide covers what actually works for receiving international payments in Iraq in 2026 — tested from Erbil, Sulaymaniyah, and Baghdad.

## The Core Problem

Iraq's financial infrastructure has improved significantly, but it still has gaps that affect online earners:

- **PayPal** doesn't allow Iraqi residents to receive payments (you can send but not receive — which is useless for freelancers)
- **Stripe** doesn't support Iraqi businesses for payment processing
- **Many international banks** flag Iraqi accounts for enhanced compliance checks, causing delays
- **Currency conversion** between USD and IQD often happens at unfavorable rates through local money exchangers

The good news: there are reliable workarounds, and they've gotten significantly better in the last two years.

## Method 1: Payoneer — The Freelancer Standard

Payoneer is the most widely used payment method for freelancers in Iraq, and for good reason. It works, it integrates with major platforms, and you can get a physical Mastercard that works at Iraqi ATMs.

**How to set it up:**
1. Sign up at Payoneer.com with your Iraqi passport or national ID
2. Complete identity verification — this typically takes 2-3 business days
3. You'll receive a virtual account with US, UK, EU, and other bank details
4. Order the physical Mastercard (shipped to Iraq, takes 2-4 weeks)

**How you receive money:**
- Freelancing platforms like Upwork, Fiverr, and Freelancer.com deposit directly to your Payoneer account
- Clients can pay you via your Payoneer bank details (looks like a regular US bank transfer to them)
- Other Payoneer users can send you money directly (common in the Iraqi freelancer community)

**Getting cash in Iraq:**
- Withdraw from ATMs using the Payoneer Mastercard — works at most Iraqi ATMs, though FIB (First Iraqi Bank) and BBAC ATMs are most reliable
- Withdrawal fees: $3.15 per ATM transaction, plus the ATM operator's fee
- Daily limit: $2,500 typically, though this varies by ATM
- You receive IQD at the current exchange rate

**Fees:**
- Receiving from marketplaces: Free
- Receiving from clients via bank transfer: Up to $3 per transaction
- Currency conversion: 2% above mid-market rate
- ATM withdrawal: $3.15 per transaction
- Annual card fee: $29.95

**Pro tips:**
- Keep funds in USD inside Payoneer as long as possible. The IQD exchange rate fluctuates, and you'll get better rates at certain times.
- Use Payoneer's "Make a Payment" to pay for subscriptions and services directly — avoids conversion fees.
- If you earn over $1,000/month, contact Payoneer support to negotiate lower fees. They have VIP tiers that aren't publicly advertised.

## Method 2: Wise (TransferWise) — Best Exchange Rates

Wise offers some of the best exchange rates available for converting international currencies. They now support Iraqi residents for receiving money, though with some limitations.

**How it works:**
- Sign up and verify identity with your Iraqi passport
- You get multi-currency account details (USD, EUR, GBP, etc.)
- Clients send money to these details like a regular bank transfer
- You can hold multiple currencies and convert at the real mid-market rate

**Getting cash in Iraq:**
- Wise offers a debit card that works at Iraqi ATMs, though availability has been inconsistent
- You can send funds from Wise to a local Iraqi bank account (FIB, Kurdistan International Bank, or RT Bank tend to work best)
- Transfer to a local bank takes 1-3 business days

**Fees:**
- Receiving USD by wire: Free
- Currency conversion: 0.43-0.65% (significantly cheaper than Payoneer)
- Sending to Iraqi bank: Varies, typically $1-5

**Limitations:**
- Not as widely integrated with freelancing platforms as Payoneer
- The debit card can be finicky at Iraqi ATMs — not all accept it
- Customer support response times can be slow for Iraq-specific issues

**Best for:** People who receive larger payments ($500+) where the better exchange rate saves meaningful money compared to Payoneer's 2% conversion fee.

## Method 3: Direct Bank Transfer (Wire Transfer)

For larger payments — retainer clients, project fees over $1,000, or business-to-business work — direct wire transfers to an Iraqi bank account remain viable.

**Best banks for receiving international transfers:**
- **Kurdistan International Bank (KIB)** — generally the smoothest for international wires in the Kurdistan Region
- **First Iraqi Bank (FIB)** — widely available, decent international transfer handling
- **RT Bank** — good for business accounts, responsive to international transfer issues

**What you need:**
- Business or personal account at one of these banks
- SWIFT/BIC code for your bank
- Your IBAN number
- You'll share these details with your client

**Fees:**
- Receiving wire: $15-30 per transfer (your bank's fee)
- Client's sending fee: $25-50 (their bank's fee)
- Total: $40-80 per transfer in combined fees

**When it makes sense:** Only for payments over $1,000 where the fixed fees become proportionally small. A $50 fee on a $5,000 transfer is 1%. The same fee on a $200 transfer is 25% — unacceptable.

## Method 4: Cryptocurrency — The Growing Alternative

Crypto usage for freelancer payments has grown significantly in Iraq since 2024. It's not for everyone, but it solves some real problems.

**Why some Iraqi freelancers prefer crypto:**
- No intermediary bank to block or delay transfers
- Works during internet restrictions (with a VPN)
- Can be converted to IQD through local exchanges
- Near-instant settlement
- Low fees on networks like Solana or Tron (USDT-TRC20)

**Practical approach for beginners:**
1. Ask clients to pay in **USDT (Tether)** — it's pegged to USD, so no crypto volatility risk
2. Use the **TRC-20 network** (Tron) for transfers — fees are typically under $1
3. Receive into a self-custody wallet like **Trust Wallet** or **MetaMask**
4. Convert to IQD through local exchanges

**Converting crypto to cash in Iraq:**
- **Local P2P exchanges:** There's an active community of crypto-to-cash exchangers in Erbil and Sulaymaniyah. Telegram groups are the most common way to find them. Rates are usually 1-2% off market price.
- **Binance P2P:** Binance's peer-to-peer platform has Iraqi traders who accept local bank transfers or cash. You sell your USDT and receive IQD in your bank account or via local delivery.
- **Local crypto shops:** In Erbil's Iskan area and Sulaymaniyah's Salim Street area, physical shops will exchange crypto for cash. Rates vary — shop around.

**Risks to understand:**
- Crypto regulation in Iraq is evolving and somewhat unclear. There's no outright ban, but there's no formal regulatory framework either.
- P2P exchanges carry scam risk — use escrow services (Binance P2P has built-in escrow) and never release crypto before confirming payment.
- If you hold crypto rather than immediately converting, you're exposed to market volatility (except with stablecoins like USDT or USDC).

## Method 5: Freelancing Platform Wallets

If you work on platforms like Upwork or Fiverr, their built-in payment systems connect to the methods above.

**Upwork:** Pays to Payoneer, Wise, wire transfer, or PayPal (limited use in Iraq). Payoneer is the most practical option. Upwork charges a 10% service fee on the first $500 with each client (dropping to 5% after $10,000).

**Fiverr:** Pays to Payoneer, bank transfer, or Fiverr Revenue Card. Again, Payoneer is the smoothest option from Iraq. Fiverr takes 20% of each order.

**Freelancer.com:** Supports Payoneer and wire transfer. Their fees are competitive with Upwork for most job sizes.

**Tip:** If you're just starting freelancing, Fiverr has the lowest barrier to entry despite the higher fee percentage. You can set up a profile and start receiving orders within days. As you grow, move to Upwork where the fee structure rewards long-term client relationships.

## Method 6: Money Transfer Services

For occasional payments rather than regular freelancing income:

- **Western Union / Ria:** Clients can send money that you pick up in cash at local branches. Fees are high (5-10%), but it's simple and doesn't require any account setup.
- **Zain Cash / Asia Hawala:** Mobile money services that some international clients can send to. Convenient for smaller amounts but limited international integration.
- **Hawala networks:** Traditional money transfer networks remain active and efficient for certain corridors, particularly from Gulf countries.

## Choosing Your Setup

Here's my recommendation based on your situation:

**Just starting out, earning under $500/month:**
- Payoneer account with Mastercard
- That's it — keep it simple

**Regular freelancing, $500-3,000/month:**
- Payoneer as primary for platform payments
- Wise as secondary for direct client payments (better rates)
- A local bank account at KIB or FIB for receiving transfers from either

**Earning over $3,000/month:**
- All of the above
- Add crypto (USDT) as an option for crypto-comfortable clients
- Consider a business bank account for tax documentation
- Negotiate VIP rates with Payoneer

## Tax Considerations

This deserves its own article, but briefly: Iraq does have income tax obligations for residents. The Kurdistan Region has its own tax authority. If you're earning significant income online, consult with a local accountant — they exist and they're familiar with freelancer income. The cost of an accountant is far less than the cost of a tax surprise.

## The Practical Reality

Getting paid online from Iraq requires more setup than it would in Turkey or Jordan, but it's entirely workable. The ecosystem has improved dramatically since 2023. Payoneer alone has made freelancing viable for thousands of Iraqi professionals.

Start with Payoneer, add Wise when you grow, and keep crypto as an option for clients who prefer it. Don't overcomplicate it — the goal is to spend your time doing work, not managing payment infrastructure.
